    <p>As the province with the greatest biodiversity in Canada, many wild animals call British Columbia home. From industrious beavers to intelligent wolves, the unique and rich landscape of the province provides diverse ecosystems for a range of animal species. While seeing British Columbiaâ€™s native wildlife can be an awe-inspiring experience, we need to be mindful that our actionsb<br> and activities can have negative impacts on wild animals. <br>Negative encounters (sometimes called conflict) between humans and wildlife are often the result of human actions, so we all have a responsibility to help protect wildlife while we visit their habitats.</p>
