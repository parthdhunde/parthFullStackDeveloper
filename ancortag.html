    mahatma gandhi
    <p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (ISO: Mōhanadāsa Karamacaṁda Gāṁdhī;[pron 1] 2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was an
        Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the
        successful campaign for India's independence from British rule. He inspired movements for civil rights and
        freedom across the world. The honorific Mahātmā (from Sanskrit 'great-souled, venerable'), first applied to him
        in South Africa in 1914, is now used throughout the world.



        Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, Gandhi trained in the law at the Inner Temple in London,
        and was called to the bar in June 1891, at the age of 22. After two uncertain years in India, where he was
        unable to start a successful law practice, he moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a
        lawsuit. He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years.

        There, Gandhi raised a family and first employed
        nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights. In 1915, aged 45, he returned to India and soon set about
        organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against discrimination

        and excessive land-tax</p>

            <p>Shri Jawaharlal Nehru
                August 15, 1947 to May 27, 1964 | Congress
                Shri Jawaharlal Nehru

                Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru was born in Allabahad on November 14, 1889. He received his early education athome
                under private tutors. At the age of fifteen, he went to England and after two years at Harrow, joined
                Cambridge University where he took his tripos in Natural Sciences. He was later called to the Bar from
                Inner Temple. He returned to India in 1912 and plunged straight into politics. Even as a student, he had
                been interested in the struggle of all nations who suffered under foreign domination. He took keen
                interest in the Sinn Fein Movement in Ireland. In India, he was inevitably drawn into the struggle for
                independence.

                In 1912, he attended the Bankipore Congress as a delegate, and became Secretary of the Home Rule League,
                Allahabad in 1919. In 1916 he had his first meeting with Mahatma Gandhi and felt immensely inspired by
                him. He organised the first Kisan March in Pratapgarh District of Uttar Pradesh in 1920. He was twice
                imprisoned in connection with the Non-Cooperation Movement of 1920-22.

                Pt. Nehru became the General Secretary of the All India Congress Committee in September 1923.He toured
                Italy, Switzerland, England, Belgium, Germany and Russia in 1926. In Belgium, he attended the Congress
                of Oppressed Nationalities in Brussels as an official delegate of the Indian National Congress. He also
                attended the tenth anniversary celebrations of the October Socialist Revolution in Moscow in 1927.
                Earlier, in 1926, at the Madras Congress, Nehru had been instrumental in committing the Congress to the
                goal of Independence. While leading a procession against the Simon commission, he was lathi-charged in
                Lucknow in 1928. On August 29, 1928 he attended the All-Party Congress and was one of the signatories to
                the Nehru Report on Indian Constitutional Reform, named after his father Shri Motilal Nehru. The same
                year, he also founded the ‘Independence for India League’, which advocated complete severance of the
                British connection with India, and became its General Secretary.

                In 1929, Pt. Nehru was elected President of the Lahore Session of the Indian National Congress, where
                complete independence for the country was adopted as the goal. He was imprisoned several times during
                1930-35 in connection with the Salt Satyagraha and other movements launched by the Congress. He
                completed his ‘Autobiography’ in Almora Jail on February 14, 1935. After release, he flew to Switzerland
                to see his ailing wife and visited London in February-March, 1936. He also visited Spain in July 1938,
                when the country was in the throws of Civil War. Just before the court-break of the Second World War, he
                visited China too.

                On October 31, 1940 Pt. Nehru was arrested for offering individual Satyagraha to protest against India’s
                forced participation in war. He was released along with the other leaders in December 1941. On August 7,
                1942 Pt. Nehru moved the historic ‘Quit India’ resolution at the A.I.C.C. session in Bombay. On August
                8,1942 he was arrested along with other leaders and taken to Ahmednagar Fort. This was his longest and
                also his last detention. In all, he suffered imprisonment nine times. After his release in January 1945,
                he organized legal defence for those officers and men of the INA charged with treason. In March 1946,
                Pt. Nehru toured South East Asia. He was elected President of the Congress for the fourth time on July
                6, 1946 and again for three more terms from 1951 to 1954.

            <p>लाल बहादुर शास्त्री ( उच्चारण [lɑːl bəˈhɑːd̪ʊɾ ˈʃɑːst̪ɾi] ⓘ ;के रूप में जन्म;2 अक्टूबर 1904 - 11 जनवरी
                1966) एक भारतीय राजनीतिज्ञ और राजनेता थे, जिन्होंने 1964 से 1966 तक भारत के दूसरेप्रधान मंत्री1961 से
                1963 तक छठेगृह मंत्री

                शास्त्री का जन्म 2 अक्टूबर 1904 को मुगलसराय में शरद प्रसाद श्रीवास्तव और रामदुलारी देवी के घर हुआ था।
                उन्होंने ईस्ट सेंट्रल रेलवे इंटर कॉलेज और हरीश चंद्र हाई स्कूल में पढ़ाई की, जिसे उन्होंने असहयोग आंदोलन
                में शामिल होने के लिए छोड़ दिया । उन्होंने मुजफ्फरपुर में हरिजनों की भलाई के लिए काम किया और अपना
                जाति-व्युत्पन्न उपनाम "श्रीवास्तव" हटा दिया। स्वामी विवेकानन्द , महात्मा गांधी और एनी बेसेंट के बारे में
                पढ़कर शास्त्री के विचार प्रभावित हुए । गांधीजी से बेहद प्रभावित और प्रभावित होकर, वह 1920 के दशक में
                भारतीय स्वतंत्रता आंदोलन में शामिल हो गए। उन्होंने लाला लाजपत राय द्वारा स्थापित सर्वेंट्स ऑफ द पीपल
                सोसाइटी (लोक सेवक मंडल) के अध्यक्ष के रूप में कार्य किया और भारतीय राष्ट्रीय कांग्रेस में प्रमुख पदों पर
                रहे । 1947 में स्वतंत्रता के बाद, वह भारत सरकार में शामिल हो गए और प्रधान मंत्री नेहरू के प्रमुख कैबिनेट
                सहयोगियों में से एक बन गए, पहले रेल मंत्री (1951-56) के रूप में, और फिर गृह मंत्री सहित कई अन्य प्रमुख
                पदों पर रहे ।

                प्रधान मंत्री के रूप में, शास्त्री ने आनंद, गुजरात के अमूल दूध सहकारी का समर्थन करके और राष्ट्रीय डेयरी
                विकास बोर्ड बनाकर श्वेत क्रांति - दूध के उत्पादन और आपूर्ति को बढ़ाने के लिए एक राष्ट्रीय अभियान - को
                बढ़ावा दिया । भारत के खाद्य उत्पादन को बढ़ावा देने की आवश्यकता को रेखांकित करते हुए, शास्त्री ने 1965
                में भारत में हरित क्रांति को भी बढ़ावा दिया । इससे खाद्यान्न उत्पादन में वृद्धि हुई, खासकर पंजाब ,
                हरियाणा और उत्तर प्रदेश राज्यों में । उन्होंने दूसरे भारत-पाकिस्तान युद्ध के दौरान देश का नेतृत्व किया ।
                उनका नारा " जय जवान, जय किसान " ("सैनिक की जय, किसान की जय") युद्ध के दौरान बहुत लोकप्रिय हुआ। 10 जनवरी
                1966 को ताशकंद घोषणा के साथ युद्ध औपचारिक रूप से समाप्त हो गया ; अगले दिन शास्त्री की मृत्यु हो गई।

            bhagat Singh
            <p>Bhagat Singh (28 September 1907[1] – 23 March 1931) was an Indian anti-colonial revolutionary,[3] who
                participated in the mistaken murder of a junior British police officer in December 1928[4] in what was
                to be retaliation for the death of an Indian nationalist.[5] He later took part in a largely symbolic
                bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi and a hunger strike in jail, which—on the back of
                sympathetic coverage in Indian-owned newspapers—turned him into a household name in the Punjab region,
                and after his execution at age 23 into a martyr and folk hero in Northern India.[6] Borrowing ideas from
                Bolshevism and anarchism,[7] the charismatic Singh[8] electrified a growing militancy in India in the
                1930s, and prompted urgent introspection within the Indian National Congress's nonviolent but eventually
                successful campaign for India's independence.[9]

                In December 1928, Bhagat Singh and an associate, Shivaram Rajguru, both members of a small revolutionary
                group, the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (also Army, or HSRA), shot dead a 21-year-old
                British police officer, John Saunders, in Lahore, Punjab, in what is today Pakistan, mistaking Saunders,
                who was still on probation, for the British senior police superintendent, James Scott, whom they had
                intended to assassinate.[10] They held Scott responsible for the death of a popular Indian nationalist
                leader Lala Lajpat Rai for having ordered a lathi (baton) charge in which Rai was injured and two weeks
                thereafter died of a heart attack. As Saunders exited a police station on a motorcycle, he was felled by
                a single bullet fired from across the street by Rajguru, a marksman.[11][12] As he lay injured, he was
                shot at close range several times by Singh, the postmortem report showing eight bullet wounds.[13]
                Another associate of Singh, Chandra Shekhar Azad, shot dead an Indian police head constable, Channan
                Singh, who attempted to give chase as Singh and Rajguru fled.[11][12]

                After having escaped, Bhagat Singh and his associates used pseudonyms to publicly announce avenging
                Lajpat Rai's death, putting up prepared posters that they had altered to show John Saunders as their
                intended target instead of James Scott.[11] Singh was thereafter on the run for many months, and no
                convictions resulted at the time. Surfacing again in April 1929, he and another associate, Batukeshwar
                Dutt, set off two low-intensity homemade bombs among some unoccupied benches of the Central Legislative
                Assembly in Delhi. They showered leaflets from the gallery on the legislators below, shouted slogans,
                and allowed the authorities to arrest them.[14] The arrest, and the resulting publicity, brought to
                light Singh's complicity in the John Saunders case. Awaiting trial, Singh gained public sympathy after
                he joined fellow defendant Jatin Das in a hunger strike, demanding better prison conditions for Indian
                prisoners, the strike ending in Das's death from starvation in September 1929.

                Bhagat Singh was convicted of the murder of John Saunders and Channan Singh, and hanged in March 1931,
                aged 23. He became a popular folk hero after his death. Jawaharlal Nehru wrote about him: "Bhagat Singh
                did not become popular because of his act of terrorism but because he seemed to vindicate, for the
                moment, the honour of Lala Lajpat Rai, and through him of the nation. He became a symbol; the act was
                forgotten, the symbol remained, and within a few months each town and village of the Punjab, and to a
                lesser extent in the rest of northern India, resounded with his name."[15] In still later years, Singh,
                an atheist and socialist in adulthood, won admirers in India from among a political spectrum that
                included both communists and right-wing Hindu nationalists. Although many of Singh's associates, as well
                as many Indian anti-colonial revolutionaries, were also involved in daring acts and were either executed
                or died violent deaths, few came to be lionised in popular art and literature as did Singh, who is
                sometimes referred to as the Shaheed-e-Azam ("Great martyr" in Urdu and Punjabi).[16]
